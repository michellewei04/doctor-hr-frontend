# Basic Heart Rate Viewer

__Contributors:__ Michelle Wei

__Description:__ Frontend viewer for heart rate information from my heart rate web service.

## Instructions

Make sure you have Node and NPM installed and enable CORS (cross-origin resource sharing) in your browser. This is available as an extension in Chrome.

Launch npm on your local machine:
```
npm run
```
This will launch the Frontend viewer in the browser with URL: `http://localhost:3000/`

You can then enter an email to view heart rate information and timestamps from that user.
